# Autonomous-Air-Defense-Drone-Orbeez-Turret-Drone-
This is a fast moving turret drone that identities targets(pole sticking out of the ground with red paper mask), tracks their movement( me moving the poles, around the yard) using a camera connected a Jetson Nano that runs YOLOv11(computer vision software) trained using my own custom data set or a data set I find online that fits my needs.
